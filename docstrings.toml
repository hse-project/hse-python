The HSE KVDB attempts to maintain reasonable QoS and for high-throughput
clients this results in very short sleep's being inserted into the put path.
For some kinds of data (e.g., control metadata) the client may wish to not
experience that delay. For relatively low data rate uses, the caller can set
the ``KvsPutFlags.PRIO`` flag for an ``Kvs.put()``. Care should be taken when
doing so to ensure that the system does not become overrun. As a rough
approximation, doing 1M priority puts per second marked as PRIO is likely an
issue. On the other hand, doing 1K small puts per second marked as PRIO is
almost certainly fine.

[hse.KvdbTransactionState]
__doc__ = """
Transaction state.
"""

[hse.KvdbTransaction]
__doc__ = """
The HSE KVDB provides transactions with operations spanning KVSs within a
single KVDB. These transactions have snapshot isolation (a specific form of
MVCC) with the normal semantics (see "Concurrency Control and Recovery in
Database Systems" by PA Bernstein).

One unusual aspect of the API as it relates to transactions is that the data
object that is used to hold client-level transaction state is allocated
separately from the transaction being initiated. As a result, the same object
handle should be reused again and again.

In addition, there is very limited coupling between threading and
transactions. A single thread may have many transactions in flight
simultaneously. Also operations within a transaction can be performed by
multiple threads. The latter mode of operation must currently restrict calls
so that only one thread is actively performing an operation in the context of
a particular transaction at any particular time.

The general lifecycle of a transaction is as follows:

                      +----------+
                      | INVALID  |
                      +----------+
                            |
                            v
                      +----------+
    +---------------->|  ACTIVE  |<----------------+
    |                 +----------+                 |
    |  +-----------+    |      |     +----------+  |
    +--| COMMITTED |<---+      +---->| ABORTED  |--+
       +-----------+                 +----------+

When a transaction is initially allocated, it starts in the INVALID state.
When ``KvdbTransaction.begin()`` is called with transaction in the INVALID,
COMMITTED, or ABORTED states, it moves to the ACTIVE state. It is an error to
call the hse_kvdb_txn_begin() function on a transaction in the ACTIVE state.
For a transaction in the ACTIVE state, only the functions
``KvdbTransaction.commit()`` or``KvdbTransaction.abort()`` may be
called.

When a transaction becomes ACTIVE, it establishes an ephemeral snapshot view
of the state of the KVDB. Any data mutations outside of the transaction's
context after that point are not visible to the transaction. Similarly, any
mutations performed within the context of the transaction are not visible
outside of the transaction unless and until it is committed. All such
mutations become visible atomically when the transaction commits.

Within a transaction whenever a write operation e.g., put, delete, etc.,
encounters a write conflict, that operation returns an error code of
ECANCELED. The caller is then expected to re-try the operation in a new
transaction, see ``HseException``.

"""

[hse.Kvs.cursor]
__doc__ = """
Non-transactional cursors:

If ``txn`` is None, a non-transactional cursor is created. Non-transactional
cursors have an ephemeral snapshot view of the KVS at the time it the cursor
is created. The snapshot view is maintained for the life of the cursor.
Writes to the KVS (put, deletes, etc.) made after the cursor is created will
not be visible to the cursor unless ``KvsCursor.update_view()`` is used to
obtain a more recent snapshot view. Non-transactional cursors can be used on
transactional and non-transactional KVSs.

Transactional cursors:

If ``txn`` is not None, it must be a valid transaction handle or undefined
behavior will result. If it is a valid handle to a transaction in the ACTIVE
state, a transactional cursor is created. A transaction cursor's view
includes the transaction's writes overlaid on the transaction's ephemeral
snapshot view of the KVS. If the transaction is committed or aborted before
the cursor is destroyed, the cursor's view reverts to same snaphsot view the
transaction had when first became active. The cursor will no longer be able
to see the transaction's writes. Calling ``KvsCursor.update_view()`` on a
transactional cursor is a no-op and has no effect on the cursor's view.
Transactional cursors can only be used on transactional KVSs.

Prefix vs non-prefix cursors:

Parameter ``filter`` can be used to iterate over the subset
of keys in the KVS whose first ``len(filter)`` bytes match the first
``len(filter)`` bytes pointed to by ``filter``.

A prefix cursor is created when:
    * KVS was created with ``prefix.length`` > 0 (i.e., it is a prefix KVS), and
    * ``filter`` != None and ``len(filter)`` >= ``prefix.length``.

Otherwise, a non-prefix cursor is created.

Applications should arrange their key-value data to avoid the need for
non-prefix cursors as they are significantly slower and more
resource-intensive than prefix cursors. Note that simply using a filter
doesn't create a prefix cursor -- it must meet the two conditions listed
above.

This function is thread safe across disparate cursors.
